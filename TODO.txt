=========================

TODO:
1.) Apply textures to landtable mesh (custom PVM? will require another export since we need to separate materials from objects and vertex colors)
2.) Find and port path data for stage from Auto Demo files
3.) Find and port original death zone and skybox data from Auto Demo files
4.) Rip all the (usable) data from STG02.bin/1ST_READ.bin (stage object models, possibly different common object models, animations, etc)
5.) Port over and replace object list from STG02
6.) Port over "static" objects (simple or no animation, little to no branching in loading subroutines), foiliage, building structures, etc
7.) Attempt at porting over all other objects from STG02 (with logic that match or mimmick the original based on the disassembly)
8.) Apply textures to ported objects (texture names for WINDY_OBJ.pvm are referenced in STG02.bin along with what object uses said textures).
9.) Reconstruct Windy Valley Act 2 landtable with available remaining data (see wiki to understand what we have)
??.) Port other AutoDemo levels (new project)?
